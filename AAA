<h1><center>Buddha info</center></h1><h2><center>The Buddha Fruit is a Legendary Beast-type Blox Fruit,
 that costs MoneyIcon 1,200,000 or Robuxcoin 1,650 from the Blox Fruit Dealer.
 </center></h2><p align=left><h3>Due to its ability to increase the user's Fighting Style and Swordâ€™s 
 range, it is considered as the best fruit for Raids and grinding. It has a low value in money but is 
 still a lot worth in trading due to its many uses.
Buddha Fruit users can use Swords, Fighting Styles and Guns when transformed, making the fruit 
particularly useful for players focused on fighting style or sword combat. It makes the weapon or 
fighting style have a much larger hitbox compared to other players. However, it does not affect the 
range and size of Guns.</h3></p><img width="92" height="92" src=img0.png></img><img width="92"
